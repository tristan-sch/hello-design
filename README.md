## Intro

- Since I have to design a website for the travel agency I work for, **AD Travel**, I decided to link this assignment to it.

- I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q3FV65ZrUs)

- Before I start presenting the assignment, I would like to link my design article about [The Gestalt Principles](https://tristan-sch.github.io/Gestalt-article/) from Module 1 which helped my doing this one.

## What did I do?

- I started creating a UI design.

- I did not design a complete website but I used all the concepts.

## 1. Whitespace

_"Whitespace is the empty space between the elements in your user interface."_

**--> On figma**: You can see the use of whitespace in the _tours-container_, in and outside the boxes.

## 2. Alignment

_"Alignment is the process of ensuring that every element is positioned correctly in relation to other elements."_

**--> On figma**: You can see the alignment between all elements. Imagine invisible horizontal and vertical lines to see it. :)

## 3. Contrast

_"Contrast is defined as being in a "strikingly" different state from something else."_

**--> On figma**: You can see contrast on the CTA for example.

## 4. Color

_"The first UI design fundamental that shapes user's experience is color."_

**--> On figma**: I think I spent the most time on the colors. I even created two palettes since I was unsure.

- I took the blue/green from the AD Travel logo as a basis
- I created a lighter version playing on the contrast
- I wanted to have a green for the sustainability aspect
- The yellow is for the Icelandic summer and midnight sun
- The orange for the Icelandic unset

## 5. Scale

_"The size of every UI element must be carefully considered."_

**--> On figma**: You can see it as well in the _tours-container_.

## 6. Typography

_"Good typography requires the understanding of other fundamentals, along with few special considerations"_

**--> On figma**: It took me also a bit of time. I found this pairing online and I find it appropriate. I looked for a light and engaging font. Something nice to look at, without complexity.

## 7. Proximity

_"When we see objects that are close to each other as more related than objects that are far apart."_

**--> On figma**: Once again, can see it with the _boxes_, or the _color-palettes_, or the _nav-menu_.

## 8. Visual Hierarchy

_"Every element on a UI has a level of importance Visual hierarchy is how we establish this importance."_

**--> On figma**: This one is somehow biased by the color-palettes but you can see the titles, pictures and CTA should stand out.
